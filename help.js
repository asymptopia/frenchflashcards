To define flashcards, put info as colon-separated pairs in the right-hand-side text area.  The simplest way to make a flashcard is to simply type into the textarea, for example, \"bonjour:hello\", then hit the \"Go\" button.  You can further configure which side shows first (Mode A:B Toggle), whether to require the user to actually <i>type</i> the answer (Mode Active:Passive Toggle), and how many seconds of delay when in passive mode.  The Special Characters buttons will type special characters to the flashcards textarea or the answer textarea (active mode).  Recommended usage is to maintain your vocabulary list in an external text file, then cut-and-paste it into the flashcards textarea as desired</p> <p>The leftmost panel contains a list of verbs which are known unto the application.  Select any verbs you wish to practice.  Then choose conjugations you wish to practice from the middle panel.  Press the \"Generate\" button to automatically populate the flashcard textarea with colon-separated flashcard pairs corresponding to your configuration.  Note: not all verb conjugations are completely translated yet -- at least you will find infinitif, présent, passé composé, futur et les participes. Other conjugations still need to be translated and (manually) entered into the verbs_fr.js database file.</p>  <p>The Verb Admin page allows the user to easily copy-and-paste verb conjugations from <a href=\"http://www.leconjugueur.com/frconjonline.php\" target=_blank >this website</a>.  Once entered, pushing the \"Save\" button creates a verb structure that the application understands and displays it in an alert popup.  The user must then copy the structure from the popup and paste it into the verbs_fr.js file manually.  This eliminates all the overhead associated with databases and over-the-web transactions, and allows the application to be used by anyone, anywhere, without the need for a database.</p>";
